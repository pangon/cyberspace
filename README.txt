This is the first published version, the 0.08.
No public changelog is available prior to this version.

The current game version is higly instable and incomplete but has all the base elements to set up a client/server LAN game environment, developed in C++, with graphical interface hybrid 2D/3D, thanks to SDL and OpenGL.

The game inspiration is a game simulation of a cyberpunk cyberspace, where users can mentally upload them inside a net of cyberspace servers, trying to develop neural programs to upgrade their own minds to be able to break the physical/access/perception/movement/communication rules of the virtual worlds and complete their missions.

The neural programming is implemented with several 2D logic minigames where the mental skills of the players are measured.

The whole game was developed from scratch, and it greatly need optimizations in almost any aspect of the code.
It contains some coding efforts to make it compilable on both linux and windows platform, but currently the only working one is the linux version of client and server.
The game was initially developed for an italian cyberpunk LARP group, therefore there are several residual texts inside it in italian language.

I'm hoping someone will make good use of this code, hopefully extending the game elements or solving some technical issues or bugs, I really want to play it online :)
